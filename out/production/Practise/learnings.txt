-> a function to convert a number to any base! (how crazy is that)
-> Holy fuck that actually existed dude!
Integer.toString(number,base)

-> 2D arrays sorting using lambda
Arrays.sort(score, (a, b) -> {
     return a[k] - b[k];
});

PRETTY COOL FINDING - conceptual
-> taking the list present inside hashmap and storing it somewhere else
-> That was actually something I have seen for the first time as well
-> Basically hashmap is storing the pointer only na, so you can pick it from there, and store it in list
