(Features of Graph)

-> may be bidirectional
-> may have cycle
-> may not be connected 

(Types of Graph)
-> Directed 
-> Undirected
-> Weighted
-> Unweighted

-> Adjacency list & Adjacency Matrix (for both of them)
-> Array of ArrayList (adjacency list) (pair, int)

Questions
-> What is the transpose of adjacency matrix in undirectional Graph
Ans. Same graph bruh 
-> Max edges in a graph (formula) (in terms of vertex)
Ans. n(n-1)/2


COMPLEXITIES Of Graph

                |   Matrix            |  List
add Edge        |    O(2)             |  O(2)
add Vertex      |    O(V^2)           |  O(V^2) (if using array of arraylist)
remove edge     |    O(2)             |  O(2 * (V-1)) == O(V) 
remove vertex   |    O(2*V) == O(V)   |  O(V^2) == O((V-1)*(V-1))


(Notes)
-> Cycle is never possible in two vertices!!! (remember that)
-> WE CAN NEVER COUNT THE NUMBER OF CYCLES IN THE GRAPH!!! (he said)
