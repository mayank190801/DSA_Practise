//We will solve all problems relating to this given certain topic for now
//let's do this bois

First
// aab -> make cuts to make leftover string palindrome!! (all actual partitions bois)
// (a,a,b), (aa,b) 

Second
// Minimum cuts required to make the given string palindrome
// aab -> 1

Third
// abc , 2 (exactly k parts needs to be palindrome!! + can change one character in it)
// return the min characters to change!!!

Fourth
// same as above!!
// k = 3 (given)

//let's level up our DP game bois
